                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Santiago Fernández Andrés, and I'm a videogame designer,
                    I studied the <strong>Game design and development</strong> career 
                    at ESNE, I chose the branch of design, but I learned on my own to script 
                    in <strong>C#</strong> in <strong>Unity</strong> and to use the engine, later, I extended
                    that knowledge to <strong>GdScript</strong> and <strong>Godot</strong>.
                </p>
     
                <h2>Working experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Between 2022 and 2023 I was working mainly as a <strong>programmer</strong> at
                    <strong>Dyp Sloom</strong>, although being a small team, I also participated as a  
                    <strong>designer</strong>, and sometimes as a <strong>tecnical artist</strong>. Together we launched 
                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1965320/Potion_Blast__Battle_of_Wizards/">Potion Blast</a> 
                    on steam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Between 2023 and 2024 I was hired to work at <strong>GGTech</strong> in Alicante
                    as a <strong>designer</strong>, which gradually ended focusing on <strong>level designer</strong>.
                    I began with them making levels for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513440/eWorlds/">eWorlds</a>, 
                    and later they commissioned us to make maps for several <strong>Fortnite</strong> events.
                    I also did some technical artist stuff, but not as much as in the previous team.
                </p>
                <h2>Personal projects</h2>
                <h3>University degree</h3>
                <p>
                    During the career we had several subjects in which we were required to make small games in teams, 
                    and also each year we had to do a video game project (which I honestly appreciate, because it 
                    was how I learned the most, and also enjoyed it a lot, although it also showed us how complicated 
                    it was to manage teams).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think we got to make a total of <strong>13 video games and board games</strong> directly from 
                    the subjects, not all of them came out, but all of them were somehow useful to learn and experiment.
                </p>

                <h4>University projects</h4>
                <p>
                    Most of the videogames we made in the race were made with a team we formed in the second 
                    year called Ashes, which I am very fond of, and in which I would dedicate myself to be a 
                    <strong>designer and programmer</strong> at the same time.
                    We would start making a game called Smash Bros Brawl style fighting game <a href="https://ashesgamedevs.itch.io/straight-outta-birbton">Straight Outta Birbton</a> 
                    (probably not the best idea) but it turned out to be a funny game of gangster bird fights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The videogame of the following year was <a href="https://ashesgamedevs.itch.io/constella">Constella</a>, 
                    a game of sailing with a boat discovering the phases of the loss, and what I learned 
                    by force with its development was that changing the vertex displacement of a model does 
                    not modify its collision, that although it sounds logical, at that time was not completely 
                    clear to me, and made us take a lot of time to have a first working prototype, because 
                    of the waves, but I'm happy with the final result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In that same year we did <strong>2 other projects in subjects</strong>, a game composed of 
                    rotation minigames with the mouse wheel called <a href="https://alvaro-marco.itch.io/rotato">Rotato</a> 
                    that turned out very well. And Russian roulette <strong>inspired card game</strong> called <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2079386799">You're Dead</a> 
                    that reminded us how difficult it is to print colors correctly.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    And in fourth year, we had a subject that pushed us to experiment more, which I really 
                    appreciate, in which we made 4 games trying uncommon concepts. They are not published, 
                    but maybe someday I'll take a look at them in case you can get some of them out, or if 
                    they need a little push to publish them.
                </p>

                <h4>Hippocratic Oath</h4> 
                <p>
                    The last project, the TFG project, being probably the one that attracted the most attention, 
                    but we couldn't release it, was Hippocratic Oath, a visual novel game, but we couldn't get 
                    it out was Hippocratic Oath, a visual novel and surgery game set in Victorian times. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the fact that there were several designers in the team, we split up the systems and 
                    the historical research. Because of my knowledge of programming, a colleague and I took 
                    care of the the design of the surgeries, in which we tried to transmit the crudeness of 
                    the situation together with the lack of knowledge, that's why we chose to make mostly all 
                    interface and mechanics diegetic, looking for a sense of tension and uncertainty, but 
                    leaving some feedback to make clear the critical situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the technical aspect, apart from programming the multiple systems that were designed, 
                    it stood out the way of interacting between different layers of a 2D body animated with 
                    bones, by using masks that were generated and modified in real time, together with beziers 
                    that defined the edges of the opening, hierarchized in such a way that they followed the 
                    animations of the model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately we could not finish it because we were running out of time at the 
                    university, and each member of the team had different objectives and needs that 
                    were incompatible.
                </p>

                <h3>Jams</h3>
                <p>
                    Jams are a concept that I like a lot, but I don't quite get the hang of it (partly because 
                    I'm too ambitious, or because I'm very indecisive) but I usually have a good time, which is 
                    the main objective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coincidentally, from the cultura abierta jams we have done, we had good outcomes, the first 
                    one was a typer called <a href="https://ashesgamedevs.itch.io/aquelarre">Aquelarre</a>, 
                    and the second one a Papers please style game of censoring artworks, <a href="https://brunok.itch.io/lienzos-de-negro">Lienzos de negro</a>, 
                    although the last one we submitted it almost out of deadline.
                </p>

                <div class="image_set">
                    <img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNTM1MzQ5LzI3ODY1NTMucG5n/original/QRNFR%2F.png" alt="Captura de Aquelarre">
                    <img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvMTMyNTExMi83NzA2MDM2LnBuZw==/original/PhLxZ4.png" alt="Captura de Lienzos de negro">
                </div>
                <p>
                    And there are also several jam games that we have not finished, and it is usually because we 
                    have overextended, although there was a time when the game broke, just like that, but at least 
                    we always had something to learn.
                </p>

                <h3>Solo Projects</h3> 
                <p>
                    I've always found it hard to do projects alone or practically on my own, I think part of what 
                    pushes me to experiment and express myself is being able to do it with other people I can be 
                    comfortable with, but even so, I've managed to get some done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the projects starts with a Mastodon user asking someone to make an application to 
                    manage tasks with timer, and for some reason, I felt like doing it, and so was born <a href="https://san-tidev.itch.io/cronotareas">Cronotareas</a>, 
                    a project with which I wanted to experiment with the interfaces and theme tool of Godot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another project I did by my own was a videogame gift card for a friend, this is something 
                    more personal, so it's not published or anything. In it I used some illustrations that another 
                    friend made, to make a digital equivalent to a gift card, with dialogues and interactions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, this website, although it's not a game, but well, I wanted to have something 
                    eye-catching to show my portfolio, and refresh HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>
                    Recently I have become interested in the concept of non-profit collaborative projects, so, 
                    being my predominant space the digital one, I have started to look into open source. <br>
                    Not only that has led me to start using Linux in my daily life, I have also ended up giving 
                    new opportunities to less popular programs, but it gives me some joy to use them, and probably 
                    what has made me delve deeper into this has been to change Unity with Godot for personal use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Coming closer to the present, I have been able to recover my old 3D printer, a BQ Hephestos, 
                    which is a type of tool that has always attracted my attention for its ability to democratize 
                    the creation of objects accurately, and on top of being able to be sustainable. <br>
                    Mine requires some maintenance for being old, but still I think it is a hobby that is worthwhile. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another of my hobbies is skiing, I haven't been able to go/dedicate time to it for a while, because 
                    I've been focused on college, work, or whatever concern I had, but I've been going since I was 
                    10 years old, and I should drop by a little more when I can.
